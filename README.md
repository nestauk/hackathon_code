# Exploration Week Code

To store code generated from the Exploration Week, we have set up a Github repo that everyone in Nesta's Github account will be able to access (but isn't accessible publicly).

## Adding code for my project:

1. Clone the repo
2. Create a relevantly named branch for your project. You will not be able to commit directly to the 'dev' branch
3. In your branch, add a new directory to the top level of the repo that represents your project. This directory is where you should store all your code, requirements and documentation generated from the week, and this branch should be treated as the core branch for your project, with other branches checked out from here.

Hopefully this workflow will be familiar to a couple of members of your project team, but if you're new to version control with git and Github and are struggling, please reach out to the #github_support channel for further help.

Why are we using a mono-repo over individual project repos?

Due to the nature of an Exploration Week, the code outputs generated tend to be small and messy. During our previous firebreak week, a large number of very short lived repos were created which were no longer maintained once the firebreak ended, which contributed to the proliferation of 'stale' repos in our Github organisation, which we're now actively trying to clean, and prevent from happening further.

Can I use an individual repo in my personal Github account?

We'd prefer this not to happen for a couple of reasons;

1. It makes it much harder for colleagues to explore this project after the Exploration Week is over
2. It's a security risk, the controls we have in place in the Nesta Github organisation won't apply

What if my project is mature enough to deserve its own repo?

We expect this to be a minority of projects, but if you feel this is the case, please get in touch with us via the #github_support channel to do this.
