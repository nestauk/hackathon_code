# Hackathon code

We have set up this Github repo, to store code generated from Nesta and BIT's hackathons, Exploration Weeks and other exploratory activities.

Note that this repo is public.

## Adding code for my project:

1. Clone the repo
2. Create a relevantly named branch for your project. You will not be able to commit directly to the 'dev' branch
3. In your branch, add a new directory to the top level of the repo that represents your project. This directory is where you should store all your code, requirements and documentation generated from your explorations, and this branch should be treated as the core branch for your project, with other branches checked out from here.

Hopefully this workflow will be familiar to a couple of members of your project team, but if you're new to version control with git and Github and are struggling, please reach out to to the #github_support Slack channel for further help.

### Why are we encouraging to use this repo over creating a new individual project repo?

Due to the nature of a hackathon or Exploration Week, the code outputs generated tend to be small and messy. We noticed that during previou events, a large number of very short lived repos were created which were no longer maintained once they ended. This contributed to the proliferation of 'stale' repos in our Github organisation, which we're now actively trying to clean, and prevent from happening further.

### Can I use an individual repo in my personal Github account?

We'd prefer this not to happen for a couple of reasons:

1. It makes it harder for colleagues to find and explore this project after the event is over
2. It might be a security risk, as the controls we have in place in the Nesta Github organisation won't apply

### What if my project is mature enough to deserve its own repo?

We expect this to be a minority of projects, but if you feel this is the case, please get in touch with us via the #github_support channel to do this.
